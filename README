libusb
======

libusb is a library for USB device access from Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows, OpenBSD/NetBSD and Haiku userspace.
It is written in C (Haiku backend in C++) and licensed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or, at your option, any later
version (see COPYING).

libusb is abstracted internally in such a way that it can hopefully
be ported to other operating systems. Please see the PORTING file
for more information.

Modification
------------
To make built library files can be compiled by Qt, project description file for Qt Creator is created in this forked project.

The following is the building environment:
System: Windows 7 64-bit
Qt Version: Qt-5.4
Compiler Base: MSVC 2013 Community Edition (x64)

You can find the project file, libusb_qt_static.pro under ./msvc/ directory. Please use your Qt Crator to open it so that you can build the static library file for libusb.lib and use it in your individual project.
